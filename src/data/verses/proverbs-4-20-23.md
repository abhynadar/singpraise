title: Proverbs 4:20-23
tags: Scripture, Health
content: My son, give attention to **my words**, Incline your ear to **my
  sayings**. Do not let them depart from your eyes; Keep them in the midst of
  your heart; For they are **life** to those who find them, and **health to all
  their flesh**. Keep you **heart** with all diligence, For out of it spring the
  **issues of life**.
