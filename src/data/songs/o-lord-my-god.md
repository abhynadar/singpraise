  O Lord my God,

  When I in awesome wonder

  Consider all the works

  Thy hands have made,

  I see the stars,

  I hear the mighty thunder,

  Thy power throughout

  The universe displayed.



  **Chorus**

  *Then sings my soul,*

  *My Saviour God to Thee;*

  *How great Thou art,*

  *How great Thou art! (repeat)*
about: >-
  Stuart K. Hine was a Bristish Methodist missionary on a mission trip in
  Ukraine in 1931 when he heard the Russian translation of a German song
  inspired by Carl Boberg's poem "O Store Gud" (O Great God). Hine began to
  translation the song to English and added several verses. The third verse was
  inspired by the conversion of villagers in Russia who cried out to God loudly
  as the repented and realized God's love and mercy - "And when I think that
  God, His Son not sparing, sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in." 



  Stuart Hine and his family left Ukraine as famine and World War Two began, and settled in Somerset, Britain where he continued to serve as a missionary to Polish refugees. The forth verse of "How Great Thou Art" was inspired by displaced Russians who experienced great loss and looked forward to seeing their loved ones again in heaven - "When Christ shall come with shoult of acclamation to take me home, what joy shall fill my heart."



  The final English version of "How Great Thou Art" was published in 1949 and quickly spread among Britian, Africa, India and America.
