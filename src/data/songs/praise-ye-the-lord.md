  Praise ye the Lord, 

  Praise God in His sanctuary 

  Praise Him in the firmament of His power 

  Praise Him for His mighty acts 

  Praise Him according to His excellent greatness 

  Praise Him with the sound of the trumpet  

  Praise Him with the psaltry and the harp 

  Praise Him with the timbrel and   dance 

  Praise Him with stringed instruments and organs 

  Praise Him upon the high sounding cymbals 

  Let everything that has breath 

  Praise the Lord 

  Praise ye the Lord
about: Psalms 150
